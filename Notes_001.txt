Probability Distribution:

Random Variable:
================

Anything which have some random outcomes. Like Roll of a dice. Denoted by Capital letters.

X = "Roll of a dice"

Discrete Random Variable: Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Values are in interval and not continuous

Continuous Random Variable: Like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and so on Where values can be continuous

Sample Space:
=============

All the possible outcomes of a random variable. For example a dice can have the following as sample sapace:

S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} as sample Space

Probability Distribution:
=========================

Probability of an event to occour. Like the outcomes on a dice have the following probabilities:

P(X=1) = 1/6
P(X=2) = 1/6
P(X=3) = 1/6
P(X=4) = 1/6
P(X=5) = 1/6
P(X=6) = 1/6

This can be denoted as Probability mass function. 
You can pass a input and it gives you the probability of it occouring as output.
This can also be represented as graph

Probability Density Function (PDF):
===================================

A probability of a discreate value is 1/n where n is no of possible outcomes.

A probability of a continuous variable is 0 because a continuous variable can take any value between 
1 to 2, the choices are infinite like 1.1, 1.11, 1.12 and so on. So the possibility of taking an 
specific value as outcome is infinite (1/infinity) hence it's probabilty is 0.

We graph the probability of an discrete variable as graph bar plots.
Because the choices are infinite we can't graph a continuous variable probability as bar plot.
Instead we use a bell curve diagram to show that it can take any value between an specific range.
Then we shade the area to denote it's probability. This is called a PDF (Probability Density Function).
In Calculus we use Integration for the same function.

----------------------      

A Parameters is a number which tells us something important about the distribution. Like
The average height is 60 in a distribution.
The average IQ is 100
The probability of occouring heads is 0.5

The Bernouli Distribution:
==========================

It's the building block of many other distributions in statistics.
It's a discrete distribution with 2 possible outcomes.
Like 0 and 1, true or false, yes or no, success or failure, head or tail etc.
We can plot this using a bar plot.

P(X=1) = p           [P(X=0) = 0.5]
P(X=0) = 1 - p       [P(X=1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5]
p ε[0,1]             
f(x) = {p, x=1 ---  1-p, x=0}

The Uniform Distribution:
=========================

It's a continuous distribution. The outcome can be anything between a range.
Like Height of a person it can be any number i.e. 5.3, 5.4, 5.41, 6.1 etc
Or a location in a 100 meters long track. It can be any number between 1 and 100.
In a continuous distribution a probability of a single event to occour is 0 because of infinite possibilities.
Hence 1/infinity is undefined or we can say it is not possible to calculate hence it is 0.
Or we can say that in a uniform distribution all the numbers have equaly likely probability of occouring.

Hence we define the Probability Density Function of a Uniform Distribution as any value between a range
with equaly likely probability.

----------------
0            100

P(X=3.1415) = 0  (It's not possible to calculate due to infinite no of possibilities)

Hence we don't have a Probability Mass Function in Uniform distribution.

When the probability of a single value is not possible then we ask for the probability of a group of numbers.
Like, what is the probability of X to be between 0 and 10
We can then shade the area between 0 and 10 in a uniform distribution graph to denote the probability.
We can find the probability as 

Sample Length x (1 / Population Length)

P(0 <= X >= 50)   (Probability of X between 0 and 50)
50 x (1 / 100) = 50 / 100 = 1/2 or 0.5
If total values are 100 than probability of X being 0 and 50 is 1/2

P(60 <= X >= 75) 
= (75 - 60) x (1/100)
= 15 x (1/100)
= 15 / 100 = 15/100 or 0.15

The Normal Distribution:
========================

It's a continuous distribution.
It is defined for all real numbers from -infinity to infinity.
It is shown on a graph as a bell curve.
Parameters are: μ (mu) = Mean and σ (sigma) = Standard Deviation

Sigma is the standard deviation of this distribution.
Variance = Summation[(xi - Mean)^2] / N
Std Dev = Square Root of (Variance)

In a Standard Normal Distribution Mean is at the center.
This means that the values are distributed equally around positive and negative sides of the mean.
We say that a Standard Normal Distribution is perfectly Symetrical.

68% of all the data is distributed under 1 std from Mean
95% of all the data is distributed under 2 std from Mean

Skewness:
=========
If the mean is not at the center it means it could be pulled/skewed towards either right or left.

If Mean is pulled to the right. This means there are some large values towards the right and 
the distribution has a long tail at right hence it is right skewed. For example a few people earns
extremely high.

If Mean is pulled to the left. This means there are some large values towards the left and 
the distribution has a long tail at left hence it is left skewed. For example most people retire
at a set age but a few retire early.
